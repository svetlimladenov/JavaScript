// Dynamic scope, by contrast, doesnâ€™t concern itself with how and where
// functions and scopes are declared, but rather where they are called
// from. In other words, the scope chain is based on the call-stack, not
// the nesting of scopes in code

// So if JS has a dynamic scope, rather than a lexical scope
// the above example should have logged 3 (not 2!);

// To be clear, JavaScript does not have a dynamic scope.
// It has lexical scope. Plain and simple.
// But the 'this' mechanist is kind of like dynamic scope,
// Probably because this is bound depending on HOW you are calling a function

// The key contrast: lexical scope is write-time, whereas dynamic scope
// (and this!) are runtime.

// Lexical scope cares where a function was
// declared, but dynamic scope cares where a function was called from.
