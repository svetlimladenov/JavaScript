// Arrow function discard all the normal rules for this binding, and instead take on the this
// value of their immediate lexical enclosing scope, whatever it is.

// While this makes for shorter code, my perspective is that arrow func‚Äê
// tions are really just codifying into the language syntax, a common
// mistake of developers, which is to confuse and conflate this binding
// rules with lexical scope rules.

// Put another way: why go to the trouble and verbosity of using the this
// style coding paradigm, only to cut it off at the knees by mixing it with
// lexical references. It seems natural to embrace one approach or the
// other for any given piece of code, and not mix them in the same piece
// of code
